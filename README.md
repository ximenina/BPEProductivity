**Current data in the repo:**

 - `csvs/` contains the languages information, measures (productivity, c.freq, idiosyncrasy) and the resulting partitions
 - `plots/` Current plots: merges per language, and all languages together
 - `sourcedata/measures_summary` One textfile per language with measures (productivity, c.freq, idiosyncrasy) for each subword.
 - `sourcedata/measures_detailed`One textfile per language. Detailed info that was used to calculate the measures. For each newly created subword we can see all the contexts (words) where the subword appears and the frequencies.
 -  `sourcedata/originalcorpora` Tokenized corpora used for experiments. 

*Source code for BPE segmentation and calculation of measures currently missing to add

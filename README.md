# Languages through the looking glass of BPE compression

(under construction)

 - `scripts/` Set of scripts for processing the text, and extracting productivity measures for the subwords obtained at each merge.
 - `outputs/` It contains  the outputs of the scripts
 - `notebooks/` These notebooks plot the BPE Space, do the  clustering, and  do some further analysis (using the generated data in outputs/) .

 - If you're interested in using the language vectors that we derived for 47 languages from the Parallel Bible Corpus, you can go directly to [outputs/BPEresults_productivity_corpusPBCtok_0_200_1/corpusPBCtok200_vectors.csv](outputs/BPEresults_productivity_corpusPBCtok_0_200_1/corpusPBCtok200_vectors.csv)
